					<h2 class="research-title">Distillation via Solar Disinfection and Rapid Sand Filtration on Reducing Pathogens and Contaminants in Water</h2> <!-- Link to actual paper (pdf file) -->
				</a>

				<p class="research-abstract">
					Water is a necessity for all human beings and is used for a variety of activities including cleaning, cooking, and drinking. Despite this, many underdeveloped countries lack access to clean drinking water. The research aimed to examine the effects of a three-phase purification procedure consisting of rapid sand filtration, solar distillation, and sterilization on 5 sewage water samples. It found that the subjection of the samples to the purification treatment caused a significant reduction in turbidity and the general presence of foreign contaminants. This was demonstrated by the reduced absorbance level and increased transmittance level for each wavelength of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), as well as the average normalization of the samplesâ€™ pH levels to near 7. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the pathogenic content of the water as indicated by pathogenic density. It was recommended that the other factors of water potability be taken into consideration in future research, and that the purification device and procedures may be utilized on unsanitary water, but further purification would be needed before being considered safe for consumption.
